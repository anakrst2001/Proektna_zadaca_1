                Even though I prefer 80s music over today's, I have to make an exception for this awesome band.
                Arctic Monkeys are not just my favourite band today, but also one of my favourite bands of all time.
                I am a fanatic for a powerful guitar riff, and Alex Turner and his bandmates really go for it in every legendary song they make.
                Some of my personal favourites include:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMupng6KQeE">A Certain Romance</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma9I9VBKPiw">Fluorescent Adolescent</a>,

                Depeche Mode is a synth-pop band from the 80s and in my opinion one of the best things that exist when it comes to
                good quality music. Songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1xrNaTO1bI">Personal Jesus</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_0sL_SQYvw">Shake the disease</a>,

                dance and sing along. Four years ago, I went to see a Depeche Mode tribute band and the atmosphere was so energetic it goes without saying that
                it was one of the best experiences of my life.

                Not many bands manage to give me an energy boost when I'm feeling down, but Red Hot Chilli Peppers certainly do.
                If you love rock as much as I do, there's no chance you don't enjoy RHCP's music. Their guitar solos are amazing and make me wish 
                I was part of a rock band myself. My personal favourite songs include: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb5aq5HcS1A">Dani California</a>, which 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnfyjwChuNU">By the way</a>(see what I did there :)), has one of the best guitar solos of all time according to me, 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fcRa5Z6LmU">The Zephyr song</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr_uHJPUlO8">Give it away</a> and many more.

                Time for something different, but equally awesome. The Cure.
                The 80s era is not complete without mentioning this inspiring band.
                I enjoy every single one of their songs and I just cannot pick one favourite, no matter how hard I try.
                Starting from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3nPiBai66M">Just like heaven</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GkVhgIeGJQ">Boys don't cry</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGgMZpGYiy8">Friday I'm in love</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmFFTkjs-O0">Pictures of you</a>, to the dark melodies of 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xik-y0xlpZ0">The forest</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijxk-fgcg7c">Lullaby</a>, they have you covered for every mood. Their melodies are truly mesmerizing!

                I don't think there is a person who has heard Queen's songs and has not fallen in love with the legend that is Freddie Mercury.
                For me, he is the best singer of all time and Queen's songs are truly timeless.
                I just can't hear Freddie sing without getting up and starting to dance around like crazy and sing along. I'm feeling energized
                so don't judge me, and please, oh please, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM">Don't stop me now</a>!

                Bryan Adams is a singer from the 80s whose music I absolutely adore. However, what I love most about him is his raspy voice.
                If I have to pick favourites, I would choose 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6TtwR2Dbjg">Heaven</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFjjO_lhf9c">Summer of 69</a>,

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6igcfvq2BQ">It's only love</a>, which is a duet with the amazing diva Tina Turner. 
                His concert was so energetic and a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I enjoyed every single second of it.
                The crowd was singing so loudly that I had the feeling I was going to become deaf.

                Now, we come to my favourite solo artist of all time. Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner.
                You might have heard of him. It's the one and only-Sting. The mere fact that this man has come to Skopje twice and I've been to see him twice says it all about how
                much I enjoy his music. I love every single song from his band-The Police, but I must admit I love the songs from his solo career even more. 
                My favourites include: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlwIDxCjL-8">Shape of my heart</a>,

                I will gladly go to enjoy his music and pick up beautiful memories.

                My favourite character is Chandler, because I appreciate good sarcasm and jokes as much as the next person, but Ross comes to close second. There is something 
                about this show that makes me happy and I just love watching it over and over again. By the way, I've watched it so many times, I know it by heart by now.

                Now let's take some time off sitcoms and get serious. Black mirror is one of the shows that really makes you think about the advancements of technology,
                but also many of the possible threats they impose to society. It is absolutely terrifying to watch, but the plot twists are amazing!

                A sequel to my favourite movie of all time, The Karate Kid, Cobra Kai really is everything I hoped it would be.
                It gives the backstory for Kreese, explains how the lives of the main characters have turned up and what is most astonishing is that they
                managed to bring all the characters from the original movie. What I love most are the callbacks and references to the 80s classic!

                According to me, The Karate Kid is the best movie of all time. Mr. Miyagi has taught me many valuable life lessons, which is the main
                reason for my appreciation of this masterpiece. Not to mention, the fight scenes are amazing! So, if you haven't watched this classic, 
                it's high time you watch it and emerge a better version of yourself by following Mr. Miyagi's ideas, which are not applicable to karate only,
                but to life as well.

                It seems like I have a thing for sports movies because Rocky is also my all-time favourite movie along with the Karate Kid.
                What I've learned from this movie is however small the odds, you have to keep fighting until the end. Nobody even gave Rocky the slightest chance,
                but he proved everyone wrong and became the heavy-weight champion of the world. I always cry at his speech about the difficulties of life in the 6th movie in the sequel, titled 
                Rocky Balboa in which he talks about how it's not about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
                In Rocky's words, that's how winning is done and he couldn't be more right. Fun fact, both the Karate Kid and Rocky have been directed by the same man,
                John G. Avildsen.

                When it comes to sports, I really enjoy watching tennis.
                My favourite tennis player of all time is Rafael Nadal, who is the embodiment of Rocky's idea to never give up.
                He had many ups and downs in his career, but he never gave up and plays every point like his life depends on it,
                no matter who he plays against. He is the definition of hard work, talent, class and fair play.

                However, my favourite team is Barcelona, which I have supported throughout my entire childhood. I love their game and team play and
                I absolute adore the players. Though they don't play at Barca anymore, Messi and Suarez are my favourite players and from the retired ones I would
                pick Iniesta and Puyol. Even though I root against Real Madrid, I still love Ozil who used to be part of the team and also the goalkeeper
                Iker Casillas.
